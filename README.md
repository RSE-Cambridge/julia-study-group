# julia Study Group

This repository is intended to act as a central resource for the julia study group at Cambridge.

![julia logo](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia-logo-graphics/blob/master/images/julia-logo-color.png)

This is a group of interested people from Research Computing Services and the Institute
of Computing for Climate Science seeking to learn the language for use in their work.


## Meetings

The group meets weekly on Mondays 2:30-3:30pm in the Exning Room at the University Information Services
on the West Cambridge Site and also online.

### Structure
Meetings are led by someone who volunteers to lead the session in advance.
They will summarise the content for that week for other participants.
They will also lead a discussion of any 'homework' from previous sessions.


## Resources

The [wiki on this repo](https://github.com/RSE-Cambridge/julia-study-group/wiki) is designed
for quick editing and sharing of resources.

We will be generally be following the [MIT Open Courseware](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Fall23/)
material on julia.
This meshes well with our interests introducing julia through numerical methods and climate modelling.

We also encourage people to participate in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
using julia in December of this year.


## Code of Conduct

Everyone participating in the _julia Study Group_ project, is expected to treat other
people with respect and more generally to follow the guidelines articulated in the
[Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).


## Contributions

Contributions and collaborations are welcome from anyone in the group.
Feel free to edit the wiki as you please.

For changes to the repository please edit in a branch and create a pull request.
